# HackerRank Challenge (Day 14: Scope)

## Objective
Today we're discussing scope. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

The absolute difference between two integers, **a** and **b**, is written as **|a-b|***. The maximum absolute difference between two integers in a set of positive integers, , is the largest absolute difference between any two integers in .

The Difference class is started for you in the editor. It has a private integer array () for storing  non-negative integers, and a public integer () for storing the maximum absolute difference.

## Task
Given a base-**10** integer, **n**, convert it to binary (base-**2**). Then find and print the base-**10** integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive **1**'s in **n**'s binary representation. When working with different bases, it is common to show the base as a subscript.

## Input Format
A  single integer, **n**.

## Output Format
Print a single base-**10** integer that donates the maximum number of consecutive **1**'s in the binary representation of **n**.

## Sample Input
```
5
```

## Sample Output
```
1
```

## Explanation
Sample Case 1:
The binary representation of **5** is **101**, so the maximum number of consecutive **1**'s is **1**.

Sample Case 2:
The binary representation of **13** is **1101**, so the maximum number of consecutive **1**'s is **2**.
