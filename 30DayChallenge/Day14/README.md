# HackerRank Challenge (Day 14: Scope)

## Objective
Today we're discussing scope. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

The absolute difference between two integers, **a** and **b**, is written as **|a-b|**. The maximum absolute difference between two integers in a set of positive integers, **elements**, is the largest absolute difference between any two integers in **_elements**.

The Difference class is started for you in the editor. It has a private integer array (**elements**) for storing **N** non-negative integers, and a public integer (**maximumDifference**) for storing the maximum absolute difference.

## Task
Complete the Difference class by writing the following:

- A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it to the **_elements** instance variable.
- A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any **2** numbers in **_elements** and stores it in the **maximumDifference** instance variable.

## Input Format
A  single integer, **n**.

## Output Format
Print a single base-**10** integer that donates the maximum number of consecutive **1**'s in the binary representation of **n**.

## Sample Input
```
5
```

## Sample Output
```
1
```

## Explanation
Sample Case 1:
The binary representation of **5** is **101**, so the maximum number of consecutive **1**'s is **1**.

Sample Case 2:
The binary representation of **13** is **1101**, so the maximum number of consecutive **1**'s is **2**.
