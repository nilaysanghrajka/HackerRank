# HackerRank Challenge (Day 10: Binary Numbers)

## Objective
In this challenge, we're working with binary numbers.

## Task
Given a base-**10** integer, **n**, convert it to binary (base-**2**). Then find and print the base-**10** integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive **1**'s in **n**'s binary representation. When working with different bases, it is common to show the base as a subscript.

## Input Format
A  single integer, **n**.

## Output Format
Print a single base-**10** integer that donates the maximum number of consecutive **1**'s in the binary representation of **n**.

## Sample Input 1
```
5
```

## Sample Output 1
```
1
```

## Sample Input 2
```
13
```

## Sample Output 2
```
2
```

## Explanation
Sample Case 1:
The binary representation of **5** is **101**, so the maximum number of consecutive **1**'s is **1**.

Sample Case 2:
The binary representation of **13** is **1101**, so the maximum number of consecutive **1**'s is **2**.
