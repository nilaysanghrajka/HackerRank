# HackerRank Challenge (Day 16: Exceptions - String to Integer)

## Objective
In this challenge, we're working with Exceptions by learning how to parse an integer from a string and print a custom error message.

## Task
Read a string, **S**, and print its integer value; if **S** cannot be converted to an integer, print *Bad String*.

## Input Format
A  single string, **SS**.

## Output Format
Print the parsed integer value of **S**, or *Bad String* if **S** cannot be converted to an integer.

## Sample Input 1
```
3
```

## Sample Output 1
```
3
```

## Sample Input 2
```
za
```

## Sample Output 2
```
Bad String
```

## Explanation
Sample Case 1 contains an integer, so it should not raise an exception when we attempt to convert it to an integer. Thus, we print the **3**.

Sample Case 2 does not contains any integers, so an attempt to convert it to an integer will raise an exception. Thus, out exception handler prints the *Bad String*.
