# HackerRank Challenge (Day 9: Recursion 3)

## Objective
In this challenge, we're going to learn about an algorithmic concept called recursion.

## Task
Complete the factorial function in the editor below. Be sure to use recursion.

factorial has the following parameter:

- int n: an integer
Returns

- int: the factorial of **n**

## Input Format
A single integer, **n** (the argument to pass to factorial).

## Output Format
Complete the method definitions provided in the editor so they meet the specifications outlined above; the code to test your work is already in the editor. If your methods are implemented correctly, each test case will print  or  lines (depending on whether or not a valid **initialAge** was passed to the constructor).

## Sample Input
```
3
```

## Sample Output
```
6
```

## Explanation
Consider the following steps. After the recursive calls from step 1 to 3, results are accumulated from step 3 to 1.
1. ***factorial(3) = 3 x factorial(2) = 3 x 2 = 6***
2. ***factorial(2) = 2 x factorial(1) = 2 x 1 = 2***
3. ***factorial(1) = 1***

## Languages
These were completed in
- Python3
- Java
- C++
- JavaScript
