# HackerRank Challenge (Day 21: Generics)

## Objective
In this challenge, we're discussing Generics.

## Task
Write a single generic function named printArray; this function must take an array of generic elements as a parameter (the exception to this is C++, which takes a vector). The locked Solution class in your editor tests your function.

## Input Format
The locked Solution class in your editor will pass different types of arrays to your printArray function.

## Output Format
Your printArray function should print each element of its generic array parameter on a new line.

## Languages
These were completed in
- Java
- C++
