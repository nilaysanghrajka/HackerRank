# HackerRank Challenge (Day 25: Running Time and Complexity)

## Objective
In this challenge, we will learn about running time, also known as time complexity.

## Task
A prime is a natural number greater than **1** that has no positive divisors other than **1** and itself. Given a number, **n**, determine and print whether it is **Prime** or **Not Prime**.

## Input Format
The first line contains an integer, **T**, the number of test cases.
Each of the **T** subsequent lines contains an integer, **n**, to be tested for primality.

## Output Format
For each test case, print whether **n** is **Prime** or **Not Prime** on a new line.

## Sample Input
```
3
12
5
7
```

## Sample Output
```
Not prime
Prime
Prime
```

## Explanation
Test Case 0: **n = 12**.
**12** is divisible by numbers other than **1** and itself (i.e.: **2, 3, 4, 6**), so we print **Not Prime** on a new line.

Test Case 1: **n = 6**.
**5** is only divisible **1** and itself, so we print **Prime** on a new line.

Test Case 2: **n = 7**.
**7** is only divisible **1** and itself, so we print **Prime** on a new line.
