# HackerRank Challenge (Day 19: Interfaces)

## Objective
In this challenge, we're learning about interfaces.

## Task
The *AdvancedArithmetic* interface and the method declaration for the abstract *divisorSum(n)* method are provided for you in the editor below.

Complete the implementation of *Calculator class*, which implements the *AdvancedArithmetic* interface. The implementation for the *divisorSum(n)* method must return the sum of all divisors of **n**.

## Input Format
A  single integer, **n**.

## Output Format
You are not responsible for printing anything to stdout. The locked template code in the editor below will call your code and print the necessary output.

## Sample Input
```
6
```

## Sample Output
```
I implemented: AdvancedArithmetic
12
```

## Explanation
The integer **6** is evenly divisible by **1**, **2**, **3**, and **6**. Our divisorSum method should return the sum of these numbers, which is **1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12**. The Solution class then prints **I implemented: AdvancedArithmetic** on the first line, followed by the sum returned by divisorSum (which is **12**) on the second line.

## Languages
These were completed in
- Python3
- Java
- C++
